CS 261 Assignment 7 Answers

1. Adjacency matrix
2. Graphs 1,2,4,5
3. With the current implementation of the Graph, the output would be the same.
   If the graph were directed, there would very likely be different output.
4. BFS is often slower but will find the shortest connection, if a connection
   exists, with certainty.  Its memory usage could grow exponentially as well.
   DFS is faster sometimes but if there is an infinite path, it may never find the 
   connection between two nodes.  It's unlikely to find the shortest path.
5. O(E), where E is the number of edges.
