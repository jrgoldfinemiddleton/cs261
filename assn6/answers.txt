CS 261 Assignment 6 Answers

1. "dear" and "read"
2. Collisions will be less likely, especially for short words.  This will, in turn, make the buckets have shorter link chains.
3. No
4. No
5. Yes
6. Yes, there are fewer empty buckets.  If the number of buckets is prime, the links will be more evenly distributed.  This makes adding, searching, and removing keys more efficient.
7. The difference is quite negligible.  In all cases I tested, the runtime was 0.00000s.  I would imagine if I hadn't had a resize function there would be a noticeable degradation in efficiency for small tables.
